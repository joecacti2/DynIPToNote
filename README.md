# DynIPToNote
DynIPToNote

So this batch file gets your IP address and writes it to a note.  You have to have evernote open on the computer, and you need an Everbook Notebook called 'IPs'.  Email me at joecacti@yahoo.com if you have any questions.  

DONE:
1) removed wget dependancy
2) Cleaned up the procedure to get var1 from the text file.
3) Renamed the files to be more representative of their functions.

TO DO:

1)  Make the executable calls non-absolute, i.e. reference them from the registry 

2)  Use memory instead of files for variables.

3) THe first Evernote 'EnScript' command pulls all of the previous IP Addresses.  Is there a way to query just the most recent?  Looking at the enscript documentation, it would have to use a counter in a 3rd file...
