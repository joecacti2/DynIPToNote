# DynIPToNote
DynIPToNote

So this batch file gets your IP address and writes it to a note.  You have to have evernote open on the computer, and you have to gave GNU wget.  You probably also have to have a Notebook called 'IPs'.  Email me at joecacti@yahoo.com if you have any questions.  

TO DO:
1)  Make the executable calls non-absolute, i.e. reference them from the registry 
2)  Remove the wget dependancy?
3)  Cleanup.  The procedure to get var1 from the text file is overkill
4)  Rename some of the files, or use memory?
